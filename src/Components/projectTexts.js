let hypersonicText = `The effectivity of thermal management using a honeycomb sandwich panel as the skin
    structure for a hypersonic aircraft wing was assessed using both theoretical and finite-element methods. 
    Two different honeycomb models, hexagonal core and square core, were analysed and results were compared
    to a conventional solid skin structure.Results showed that heat transfer through a honeycomb core is 
    noticeably reduced relative to a solid structure with core cell geometry not having a significant effect 
    on temperature distribution. Additionally a static structural analysis was carried out to determine the 
    effect of thermal loads. Conclusions drawn from this were that the hexagonal honeycomb displayed lower 
    stress values and was therefore the optimal honeycomb structure for use as the skin. Furthermore, by 
    using a hexagonal honeycomb, it was shown that material volume was reduced by approximately 67% relative 
    to a conventional solid skin structure.`;
