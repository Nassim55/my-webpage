let uavText = `My third year multidisciplinary aerospace vehicle design team project involved the 
    design of an unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly known as a UAV. The aim of this project was to 
    design a UAV that could provide a solution to a current real-world problem. My team chose to look
    at a UAV concept that could be used by the emergency services such as search and rescue teams, 
    coastguards, and police forces. 
    
    Though this concept my team were able to show that it was possible for a UAV to rapidly deliver life
    saving equipment to individuals trapped in hard to reach locations such as mountainous areas, natural
    disaster zones, and high seas. This equipment would be carried internally in the form of a capsule 
    mounted at the front of the UAV, shown in the image below. This capsule would then be jettisoned by the
    controlling pilot situated at the launch site.
    
    The success of this project relied on a solid understanding of key aerospace engineering design
    concepts such as: aerodynamics, propulsion, stability and control, finite element analysis, and 
    computer aided design modelling. Similarly, economic considerations were equally critically to 
    project success. Material and manufacturing costs often forced significant design changes from
    the original concept, and the proposed business case relied on solid research carried out on current 
    and potential future competitors.

let hypersonicText = `The effectivity of thermal management using a honeycomb sandwich panel as the skin
    structure for a hypersonic aircraft wing was assessed using both theoretical and finite-element methods. 
    Two different honeycomb models, hexagonal core and square core, were analysed and results were compared
    to a conventional solid skin structure.Results showed that heat transfer through a honeycomb core is 
    noticeably reduced relative to a solid structure with core cell geometry not having a significant effect 
    on temperature distribution. Additionally a static structural analysis was carried out to determine the 
    effect of thermal loads. Conclusions drawn from this were that the hexagonal honeycomb displayed lower 
    stress values and was therefore the optimal honeycomb structure for use as the skin. Furthermore, by 
    using a hexagonal honeycomb, it was shown that material volume was reduced by approximately 67% relative 
    to a conventional solid skin structure.`;
